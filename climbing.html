			Today is the beginning of periodized training. The first six weeks will consist of endurance training M/W/Th with potential for some climbing over the weekends time permitting. <br>
			My pinky finger is still recovering, so it is nice to have time to climb easier terrain as it heals. I am having
			some strange pains in my finger, but I think it may be due to stiffness/scarring. <br>
			There is a new spray wall set at TCB and it is perfect for training. Hopefully, I can finally work on the spray wall app.

			Training has been going pretty well. I have been trying to keep sessions short, but intense. Over the weekend I climbed with Matt and felt moderately fit. Finger is feeling better and better. Still stiff, pain when pressed opposite direction (sharp) ~90% range of motion. Easing back into open hand gripping, light/controlled crimping. <br> <br>
			On Sunday climbed several 10+ and one 11- lead. 11- took one take, strange dihedral climb to 3rd bolt and straighforward face climb after. I think I will try to rope climb every weekend, time permitting, and track some progress. Climbs were as follows: 9, 10-, 9, 10+ (1), 11- (1), 10+. (#of takes) Maybe if I start tracking some of this data, I'll do something with it.
