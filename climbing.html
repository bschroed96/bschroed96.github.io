			Today is the beginning of periodized training. The first six weeks will consist of endurance training M/W/Th with potential for some climbing over the weekends time permitting. <br>
			My pinky finger is still recovering, so it is nice to have time to climb easier terrain as it heals. I am having
			some strange pains in my finger, but I think it may be due to stiffness/scarring. <br>
			There is a new spray wall set at TCB and it is perfect for training. Hopefully, I can finally work on the spray wall app.
