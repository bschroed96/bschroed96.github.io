			Today is the beginning of periodized training. The first six weeks will consist of endurance training M/W/Th with potential for some climbing over the weekends time permitting. <br>
			My pinky finger is still recovering, so it is nice to have time to climb easier terrain as it heals. I am having
			some strange pains in my finger, but I think it may be due to stiffness/scarring. <br>
			There is a new spray wall set at TCB and it is perfect for training. Hopefully, I can finally work on the spray wall app.

			Training has been going pretty well. I have been trying to keep sessions short, but intense. Over the weekend I climbed with Matt and felt moderately fit. Finger is feeling better and better. Still stiff, pain when pressed opposite direction (sharp) ~90% range of motion. Easing back into open hand gripping, light/controlled crimping. <br> <br>
			On Sunday climbed several 10+ and one 11- lead. 11- took one take, strange dihedral climb to 3rd bolt and straighforward face climb after. I think I will try to rope climb every weekend, time permitting, and track some progress. Climbs were as follows: 9, 10-, 9, 10+ (1), 11- (1), 10+. (#of takes) Maybe if I start tracking some of this data, I'll do something with it.

			The third week of training was a bust. Only got to the gym on Monday. Was finishing up Project 1 and preparing for the midterm. Just ended up feeling like I didn't have time. Probably did, but it was also Valentines day on Friday, so I spent time with Sarah and gave up some gym time. <br> <br>
			Week four I am back to my normal schedule. Monday went pretty well, but I definitely felt the loss of fitness after a week off. Today (Wednesday) I really felt it. As compared to the session two weeks prior, I struggled to get through my normal routine on the treadwall (15 easy 15 hard for 4). I think part of it was that my focus was lacking. My thoughts were wandering and I completely neglected my breathing. Oh well, just need to keep on it. <br> <br>
			Brendan is a "go" for the Red, as is Benji (though he will be there the week after :( ). I haven't heard from Brent for a while about whether he is going or not. All in all, I will still be going. I am excited to have about 8 days to climb at the Red. Hopefully I can get out of class early and leave on Friday. This would allow me a solid 8 days of climbing. I am feeling in much better shape than the last time I was there, but it is always hard to gauge how fit I really am. Hopefully I can get on ropes next weekend and get a good benchmark of where I am at.
