		<footer id="date">1/27/20</footer>

			In lecture there was some confusion about the runtime analysis of insertion sort. [add insertion sort]
			The difficulty was with summation notation. the summation of j=2 to n for (j - 1) reduces to a closed form
			equation of n(n-1)/2. The difficulty was due to simplification.

			Last Friday got the first C project. Not too bad, spent about 6 hours on Sunday working on it. Some wierd makefile bugs, but got them fixed. Nearly there on part 1 and 2, have a bug in binary file reading and weird bug coming up about 10 elements short when reading elements in. Will look into it. Graphing is nearly there, need to update graph output loop. <br>
			<br>
			For the first functional assignment, we are just learning OCAML. The functional approach to programming seems quite intuitive right now; however, as functions grow in size and complexity I am not sure how well I will like it. Somewhat concerned about the emphasis on commenting/style, however I am planning to go over this on Thursday. <br> <br>
			Interview last Thursday with UHG and an interview this morning with Wipfli. Interview tomorrow with Multitech (onsight). Hoping to get an internship locked down soon, so I can start planning my summer travels accordingly.
