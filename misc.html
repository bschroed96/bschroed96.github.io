			Lately, productivity has been quite high. I think that is largely due to cutting off (almost all) usage of entertainment media. What I mean is, no YouTube, TV, Social Media, etc. Sure, it's nice to relax and you can't always be working on something super important, but there are infinitely better things to do than watch/read pointless media. Case and point, writing some blog posts to avoid studying. This is much more productive than watching a video about X and gaining nothing from it. At least this is somewhat constructive and I also enjoy writing about stuff. <br> <br>
			Everyone is always saying how addicted we are to our phones and social media etc. I completely agree with this, but it seems like nobody is heading the warning. What I have found is that reducing your usage time really is like quitting a drug; you can't just quit it some, you need to eliminate it completely. If I am on the bus, have some down time which cannot be utilized for anything productive, or am sitting on the toilet I usually would go to my phone. Though I use my phone for only a small while, I feel the pull of that dopamine release when I watch/read/etc. something online. I feel quite aware of the "just one more", which is really the brain craving more dopamine. Therefore, I have tried to eliminate all media consumption (albiet the occassional video/music during lunch or dinner; though, even then it can be hard to quit watching once time to start working). <br> <br>
			Since this semester I have been busy with 20 credits, I told myself I did not have time to waste if I wanted to maintain school, relationships, work, and climbing. So far, I feel more on top of my school work than many other semesters with lighter loads. I think this stems from the fact that when I have down time, I am utilizing it to do something productive. This works synergistically, as I am constantly in the mindset of "what can I get done". I rarely have time where I do absolutely nothing and watch YouTube. Though this may seem like a simple break, it drains the drive/motivation to do anything. An analogy is: it's really hard to go from napping to a full out sprint; but, if you are lightly jogging/walking acclimating to a sprint is much less harsh. "A body in motion stays in motion" and I think this goes equally for the brain. <br> <br>
			Additionally, I have been really motivated to do my homework as well. I always have a mental barrier to entry when approaching schoolwork; I don't want to get started because it seems like there is just too much to get done and I don't want to get involved. However, once I start getting into it, I can easily spend 5 hours working a single problem. It has been getting easier and easier to simply just start. Once I start, the work is usually pretty enjoyable and I really want to get whatever it is I am working on finished. I'd go as far as saying I am excited to work on some of my assignments. <br> <br>
			I really hope I can keep this level of motivation up and don't get burned out at some point. There is a lurking concern that after I return from my trip to the Red in March, I may be somewhat zapped of motivation. However, I think I can get back into the groove. Staying away from time sucking media will be my friend.
